- 👋 Hi, I’m @Eekain
- 👀 I’m interested in Java, BASH, SQL, Testing & Automation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on what I'm able to.


The basic site that I'm (usually not) working on:
*[Github host page](https://eekain.github.io)*
(Click with caution and Ctrl / CMD)
<!---
Eekain/Eekain is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes. For some reason it didn't allow opening page in new page....

OOOkay, so Mermaid works nicely

So far I'm familiar with:

```mermaid
  graph TD;
      Java core-->Selenium testing;
      Java core-->SQL;
      HTML, CSS-->UI tests;
      Selenium testing-->UI tests;
      Selenium testing-->Minor automations;
      SQL-->JDBC;
      JDBC-->MS SQL;
      JDBC-->MySQL;
      JDBC-->T-SQL;
      Java-->White box testing;
      MS SQL-->White box testing;
      MySQL-->White box testing;
      T-SQL-->White box testing;
```
